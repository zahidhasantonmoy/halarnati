## Database Recommendations

I've created two SQL scripts to help with database verification and fixing:

1. `database_schema_check.sql` - To verify the current database structure
2. `database_fix.sql` - To fix any potential database schema issues

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Security Enhancement**: Consider adding CSRF protection to all forms
2. **User Experience**: Add a "Remember Me" option to the login form
3. **Performance**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data
4. **SEO**: Add meta tags and structured data to improve search engine visibility
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure all pages meet WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards
6. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test and optimize for various mobile screen sizes
7. **Analytics**: Integrate Google Analytics or similar service for usage tracking
8. **Backup Strategy**: Implement automated database backups
9. **Error Handling**: Add more comprehensive error handling and user-friendly error pages
10. **Documentation**: Create user documentation and admin guides

## Next Steps

1. Run the `database_schema_check.sql` script to verify your database structure
2. If any issues are found, run the `database_fix.sql` script to correct them
3. Test the admin panel and profile page to ensure the errors are resolved
4. Verify that the User Panel option appears in the navigation for logged-in users
